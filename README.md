#  **Module Name**  
**Build Automation and CI CD Fundamentals**

---

#  **Module Objective**  
To help learners understand the need, role, and implementation of build automation in software development. This module will cover everything from package managers to build tools and then dive into CI CD fundamentals using Jenkins.

## Section 1 - Understanding Build and Packaging

**Goal**: Explain what build and packaging mean, and why they matter in the software lifecycle.

- 1.1 What is Build and Why it Matters  
  - From source code to executable  
  - Compilation, linking, and packaging in simple terms  
  - Build vs Run vs Deploy

- 1.2 Role of Build Automation in DevOps  
  - Why automation is needed  
  - Where build tools fit in CI CD pipeline  
  - Manual build vs automated build comparison

- 1.3 What is a Package Manager  
  - Why developers use them  
  - Installing dependencies, version locking, package.json, pom.xml, requirements.txt  
  - Package manager vs build tool

## Section 2 - Package Managers and Build Tools by Language

**Goal**: Introduce the most common tools used for build and dependency management across popular languages.

- 2.1 Java Build Tools  
  - Maven: project structure, pom.xml, goals, phases  
  - Gradle: overview and comparison with Maven  
  - Hands-on: Create a Maven Java project and build it

- 2.2 JavaScript and Node.js  
  - npm: what is it, package.json structure, common scripts  
  - yarn: what is it, how it differs from npm  
  - Hands-on: Create a Node.js app and run npm build

- 2.3 Python  
  - pip: package installation and management  
  - venv and virtualenv: isolated environments  
  - setup.py and requirements.txt  
  - Hands-on: Setup a Python project with virtualenv and requirements.txt

- 2.4 Other Tools (Brief Intro)  
  - Go Modules  
  - Rustâ€™s cargo  
  - .NET Core CLI tools  
  - When and why to explore them

## Section 3 - Build Automation Tools Overview

**Goal**: Introduce different build automation tools across ecosystems.

- 3.1 What are Build Automation Tools  
  - Automating compilation, packaging, testing, and artifact generation  
  - Trigger types: manual, scheduled, webhook-based

- 3.2 Types of Build Tools  
  - Local vs server-based  
  - Script-based (Make, Bash, npm run)  
  - Tool-based (Maven, Gradle, Ant)  
  - Pipeline-based (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)

- 3.3 Key Features to Look For  
  - Build steps  
  - Logs and debugging  
  - Caching  
  - Artifact storage

## Section 4 - CI CD Concepts and Lifecycle

**Goal**: Explain CI CD in depth before introducing Jenkins

- 4.1 What is Continuous Integration  
  - Real-world scenario: 5 developers committing every day  
  - Goals: automate testing, detect bugs early  
  - CI lifecycle explained: commit > build > test > report

- 4.2 What is Continuous Delivery  
  - Difference between CI and CD  
  - Automating release and deployment  
  - Use cases: feature flags, blue green deployment

- 4.3 What is Continuous Deployment  
  - Push to production automatically  
  - Benefits and risks  
  - Where companies draw the line

- 4.4 CI CD Pipeline Explained Step by Step  
  - Source code  
  - Build  
  - Test  
  - Deploy  
  - Monitor  
  - How pipelines are triggered: manual, webhook, cron

- 4.5 CI CD Tools in the Market  
  - Jenkins  
  - GitHub Actions  
  - GitLab CI  
  - CircleCI  
  - Azure DevOps  
  - Argo CD  
  - Bamboo  
  - TeamCity  
  - When to choose which

  - Jenkins architecture explained simply

- 5.2 Key Jenkins Concepts  
  - Job  
  - Build  
  - Pipeline  
  - Node and Agent  
  - Plugin System

- 5.3 Jenkins Use Cases  
  - Automating Java build with Maven  
  - Triggering Docker builds  
  - Deploying to Kubernetes  
  - Using with Terraform or Ansible

- 5.4 Preparing for Jenkins Deep Dive  
  - Installing Jenkins  
  - Web UI Tour  
  - What is coming in the next module

## Bonus Section - Real World Scenarios and Troubleshooting

- Build fails due to missing dependencies  
- Version mismatch issues  
- Build is successful but deployment fails  
- Continuous deployment to staging but manual approval to prod  
- Artifacts are missing or not updated
